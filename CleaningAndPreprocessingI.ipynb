Using psychometric scales to assess personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience, principal component analysis was applied to ascertain drug use reports from the sample population. Risk profiles including risk taking/avoidance behaviours, risk perception and risk tolerance are analysed to gain a deeper insight into potential correlations with mental health outcomes. Investigating these factors reveals information on how different psychosocial factors may impact on an individual’s wellbeing in times of uncertainty as experienced in this global pandemic\\n\\n### More Datasets\\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\\n\\n### Featured Notebooks\\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \\n\\n### How to use the dataset\\n&gt; This dataset contains survey responses from psychedelic and non-psychedelic drug users during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring their mental health outcomes and personality traits. It is intended for researchers to use for studying correlations between drug use and risk profile factors with mental health outcomes in order to better understand the effects of different substances on individuals’ psychological wellbeing during this unprecedented global event.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; To help you get started working with this dataset, we have provided a description of the data columns below. \\n&gt; **0_1:** Age (Numeric) \\n&gt; **0_2:** Gender (Categorical) \\n&gt; **0_3:** Education Level (Categorical) \\n&gt; **0_4:** Employment Status (Categorical) \\n&gt; **0_5: Country of Residence (Categorical) \\n&gt;  **0_6: Number of Psychedelic Drug Experiences (Numeric) \\n&gt;  **0_7 :Number of Non-psychedelic Drug Experiences(Numeric)   [This field is blank if zero]  \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  ** 0_8 :Personality Traits(Numeric)[ This field is blank if zero]    \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  ** 0_9 :Anxiety( Numeric )[ This field is blank if zero]   \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  ** 0 _ 10: Negative Affect( Numeric )[ This field is blank if zero ]    \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  ** 0 _ 11 : Positive Affect( Numeric )[ This field is blank if zero ]     \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  ** 0 _ 12 : Well - being( Numeric )[ This field is blankifzero ]     \\n&gt; \\n&gt;  $$ 0013$$$${\\\\rm \\\\ \\\\ }$$Resilience$${\\\\rm \\\\ \\\\ }$$\\\\left({\\\\rm numeric}\\\\right){\\\\rm [This~~field~~is~~blankifzero]}$$$$$${15} {16} {17} {18} {19}$$$${\\\\rm Risk~Tolerance~~~~~Risk~Aversion~~~~~Risk~Taking~~~~~~~~~~~~Risk~Avoidance~~~~Mental}{20}{21}{22}{23}{24}{25{26}}{27 {\\\\bf Health ~Outcomes}}}    $$\\\\left({\\\\rm numeric}\\\\right)\\\\mathop {{}}\\\\limits^{^{\\\\approx }}_{_. } {\\\\kern 1pts }                                                             {\\\\kern 1pts }\\\\left({{{20}, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26}, 27}\\\\right)\\\\cong ({695\\n\\n### Research Ideas\\n&gt; - Metaregression analysis exploring the impact of psychedelic and non-psychedelic drug use on mental health outcomes, such as anxiety and negative affect.\\n&gt; - Create machine learning models that can be deployed to assess the potential risk for developing mental health issues based on personality traits, substance use, risk profiles and demographics. \\n&gt; - Analyzing trends in psychedelic/non-psychedelic drug usage during the COVID-19 pandemic through a visual dashboard display for policy makers and mental health professionals to better identify at-risk groups of individuals\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4324025#.Y8OqntJBwUE)\\n&gt; \\n&gt;\\n\\n\\n### License\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \\n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

Using psychometric scales to assess personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience, principal component analysis was applied to ascertain drug use reports from the sample population. Risk profiles including risk taking/avoidance behaviours, risk perception and risk tolerance are analysed to gain a deeper insight into potential correlations with mental health outcomes. Investigating these factors reveals information on how different psychosocial factors may impact on an individual\\u2019s wellbeing in times of uncertainty as experienced in this global pandemic\\n\\n### More Datasets\\n\\u0026gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\\n\\n### Featured Notebooks\\n\\u0026gt; - \\uD83D\\uDEA8 **Your notebook can be here!** \\uD83D\\uDEA8! \\n\\n### How to use the dataset\\n\\u0026gt; This dataset contains survey responses from psychedelic and non-psychedelic drug users during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring their mental health outcomes and personality traits.

Using psychometric scales to assess personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience, principal component analysis was applied to ascertain drug use reports from the sample population. Risk profiles including risk taking/avoidance behaviours, risk perception and risk tolerance are analysed to gain a deeper insight into potential correlations with mental health outcomes. Investigating these factors reveals information on how different psychosocial factors may impact on an individual\\\\u2019s wellbeing in times of uncertainty as experienced in this global pandemic\\\\n\\\\n### More Datasets\\\\n\\\\u0026gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\\\\n\\\\n### Featured Notebooks\\\\n\\\\u0026gt; - \\\\uD83D\\\\uDEA8 **Your notebook can be here!** \\\\uD83D\\\\uDEA8! \\\\n\\\\n### How to use the dataset\\\\n\\\\u0026gt; This dataset contains survey responses from psychedelic and non-psychedelic drug users during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring their mental health outcomes and personality traits.
