This is the final project for the Erd√∂s Institute data science bootcamp in fall 2022.  The topic is Mental Health in Drug Users During COVID-19.  It uses data collected in 2020 and posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/mental-health-in-drug-users-during-covid-19).

The notebooks in this repository should be compiled in the following order:

Some of the code has print statements commented out.  These statements were included for the purposes of debugging.  It may be helpful to the reader to uncomment them to see how the code is working.
