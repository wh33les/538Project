#538 Project

In Fall 2022, I joined the Erd&#337;s Institute's Data Science Boot Camp, but started three weeks late as I was busy with teaching. Consequently, I missed the final project phase. Determined to complete a project, I embarked on a solo endeavor in February 2023, with valuable guidance from Erd&#337;s Institute staff. This project began in mid-March 2023 but was paused in April for another commitment, with brief revisits afterward.

**About the Project:**
This project involves scraping data from the 1,000 most recent posts on [FiveThirtyEightâ€™s features page,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/) capturing post type (article, video, or podcast), title, URL, authors, date and time posted, tags, and comment counts. The primary question I aim to answer is: What types of posts on FiveThirtyEight receive the most comments? See the ProblemStatement Jupyter notebook for more details.

**Project Files:**
- DataExploration Notebook: Contains the initial data exploration work. To manage length, I exported it as a .py file to import functions into the DataExplorationII notebook.
- ProblemStatementOutputs Folder: Holds output files from running the scraping code in the ProblemStatement notebook, used for exploratory analysis while debugging.
- FirstAttempts Folder: Contains files from my initial project on the effects of drug use on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, using Kaggle data. Despite abandoning the project due to low data quality, I retained these files as a learning resource in Python.

Explore this project to see how I analyze data from FiveThirtyEight and gain insights into post engagement.
