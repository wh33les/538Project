<h1>Python demonstration (featuring metadata from <a href=https://abcnews.go.com/538>fivethirtyeight.com</a>)</h1>

<p>Back in spring of 2023 I wrote a Python script that would scrape metadata from the features pages on fivethirtyeight.com.</p>
<p>The big draw is the function I wrote that would scrape the number of comments from each post.  The comments are part of a Facebook plugin and I had to use an IP rotator to access it repeatedly.</p>
<p>Below are the results from the last 1026 features posts on fivethirtyeight, as of 3 May 2024.</p>
